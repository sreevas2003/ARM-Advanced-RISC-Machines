## 1️⃣ What is ARM Architecture?
ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine.

Simple definition

  ARM architecture is a CPU design based on RISC principles, optimized for low power, high efficiency, and scalability.

### Key characteristics

  RISC-based (simple instructions)
  
  Low power consumption
  
  High performance per watt
  
  Scalable (tiny MCUs → powerful servers)
  
  Large ecosystem support

### Why ARM was created

Early computers consumed too much power

Embedded systems needed:

Low heat

Long battery life

Cheap hardware

## 2️⃣ RISC vs CISC (ARM vs x86)

| Feature                | RISC (ARM) | CISC (x86) |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Instruction size       | Fixed      | Variable   |
| Instruction complexity | Simple     | Complex    |
| Cycles per instruction | Usually 1  | Multiple   |
| Power usage            | Low        | High       |
| Hardware complexity    | Simple     | Complex    |

### ARM (RISC)

Simple instructions

More instructions per program

Faster execution pipeline

Lower power

### x86 (CISC)

Complex instructions

Fewer instructions per program

More decoding logic

Higher power consumption
